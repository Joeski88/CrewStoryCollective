      <p>We’re Kathleen & Harry, a UK-based hospitality and storytelling team on an immersive journey through South and Central America.

        With roots in the restaurant and events industry, we know how to bring spaces to life, celebrating atmosphere, culture, and the small details that create meaningful guest experiences.

        Our mission is simple: to connect deeply with local communities, amplify grassroots voices, and share authentic stories of the people and places we meet. Crew Story Collective, is a deep dive into the behind the scenes that make experiences worth living.

        We offer professional-quality photography, video, and social-ready content for hotels, restaurants, van companies, music festivals, and cultural venues. But our work goes beyond content creation. We help you showcase your space’s spirit, through walk-around tours, guest experience storytelling, food culture features, and community-focused activations.

        We’re passionate about sustainability and conscious travel. One of us is an experienced restaurant manager and events & operations consultant involved in music festivals, restaurants, brand activations, hosting, events & climate work, preparing to sail to COP30 with The Trident 20+10. The other is a doctor and photographer committed to learning Spanish, surfing, and building authentic connections along the way.

        We believe travel can be a force for good. Whether that’s helping to document local projects, support marketing for family-run hotels, or simply share the real heart of a place, we want to leave every stop better than we found it.

        Let’s tell your story together.</p>
